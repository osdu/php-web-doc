# DocBook extensions

## Table of Contents

- [General DocBook extensions](ext-general.php)
- [PEAR specific DocBook extensions](ext-pear.php)

PhD has been tailored for PHP and PEAR manuals. To make writing documentation as easy as possible, some own tags have been added to the DTD.

All extensions live in their own XML namespace "*phd:*" which resolves toÂ `http://www.php.net/ns/phd`. When using one of the attributes or tags described here, remember to set the namespace:

```
xmlns:phd="http://www.php.net/ns/phd"
```
